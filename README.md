**step one**

This step involves importing the software packages that will be used to analyze the data in the Python kernel. Then a repository of Supreme Court opinions is created and linked to the Python kernel. The next code is used to instruct the program how to analyze the repository of Supreme Court opinions.

**step two**
This step involves importing additional software packages into Python kernal for analying data related to court history. The next code is to instruct the program how to enter the data into a table (case URL, title, year, and case name). This code is saved.

**step three**

This step involves code that instructs the program to strip unhelpful words from the data. Unhelpful words include case names, state names, stopwords, people's names, and days of the week. 

**step four**

This step involves testing various models on the data to see which model is appropriate for analyzing the data. The three models to test include the Latent Dirchlet Allocation model, the Latent Semantic Analysis model, and the Non-negative Matrix Factorization model. 

**step five**

This step involves applying the model to the data. The code includes instructions for applying the model to the entire data set, applying the model again to the results to determine a topic of each case, making a dictionary of the components that make up each topic, using this dictionary to apply the topic components to the data set, and finally organizing the data for visual presentation.
